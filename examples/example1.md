***This is a WIP script for what will be a comic that is an example of play for Distorted Domains. Our 4 example characters will be in the middle of a mission fighting mobsters and tracking down a woman in Gastropolis.***

# Example of Play

Scenario: Ko and Wanda are negotiating a trade in Gastropolis. A street mime has potential information, but will not give it up freely. 

Panel 1
Ko: Where the hell did she go?
Wanda: she seems to be quite elusive.
Off-screen voice: You Lookin for Someone?

2
Wanda: Did you see a mushroom woman who passed through here?
Insectoid Mime: Maybe I did, Maybe I didn't. Maybe you should help me refresh my memory
Ko: You can talk?
Mime: Of course I can, I'm off the clock. 
Wanda: She was about this tall and...
Mime: That's nice, hon, but that's not what I meant. You want something from me, you gotta play ball
3
Ko: Play ball *how* exactly?
Mime: You want something I have, you need to give me something I want
Wanda: While we would very much like to help, this issue is rather important. Could we convince you to lend us the information on credit?
[Wanda Rolls Skilled d8 + Cryptid from the deep d6 for using cryptid wiles to make a deal, resulting in a 5 on both. The DM rolls a d4 for Wanda's Skilled harm, and a d6 for the mime. This results in success with a complication. Wanda increases her Skilled harm to a d6, and gains an inspiration for taking on harm. In this case the harm represents the anxiety Wanda has about holding up their end of the deal]
Mime: Interesting proposal, so I give you the info now, and you owe me a favor I can call in whenever?
Wanda: Uhh... yes I suppose that is what I'm proposing
Ko: Are you sure about this?
Mime: Too late bud, a deal is a deal.
Wanda: Very well
Mime: The lady went that way, and she was in a real hurry. I gotta feeling that she doesn't want to be found.
Wanda: Yes, that does seem to be the case. Thank you very much kind stranger.

Cut to Niera and Clyde fighting mobsters and running through the city

Wanda and Ko find the woman hiding in a warehouse. Wanda embraces the woman, they share a very brief tender moment, which is interrupted by explosions and gunfire outside

Ko points out that they were supposed to lead the mob away from the girl. Niera points out that they had no way of knowing the girl would be in the warehouse.

The mobsters see the girl, and say that they want their property back, she yells that they stole it from her family first.

Wanda, driven by their love attacks the mobsters outside. The others join in, defeating them and sending them running.

With the mob gone, Wanda asks if she still has it. She opens a jewelry box and says yes. The contents inside give off a glow, but are not revealed. Wanda says that she must go into hiding for her own safety.

Later, we see the crew drinking together. Ko has their arm over Wanda. Wanda points out that Ko's love interest is right over there. Niera is in the background, excitedly doing an experiment of some kind.
