***This is a WIP script for what will be a comic that is an example of play for Distorted Domains. Our 4 example characters will be in the middle of a mission fighting mobsters and tracking down a woman in Gastropolis.***

# Example of Play

Scenario: Ko and Wanda are negotiating a trade in Gastropolis. A street mime has potential information, but will not give it up freely. 

Panel 1
Ko: Where the hell did she go?
Wanda: she seems to be quite elusive.
Off-screen voice: You Lookin for Someone?

2
Wanda: Did you see a mushroom woman who passed through here?
Insectoid Mime: Maybe I did, Maybe I didn't. Maybe you should help me refresh my memory
Ko: You can talk?
Mime: Of course I can, I'm off the clock. 
Wanda: She was about this tall and...
Mime: That's nice, hon, but that's not what I meant. You want something from me, you gotta play ball
3
Ko: Play ball *how* exactly?
Mime: You want something I have, you need to give me something I want
Wanda: While we would very much like to help, this issue is rather important. Could we convince you to lend us the information on credit?
[Wanda Rolls Skilled d8 + Cryptid from the deep d6 for using cryptid wiles to make a deal, resulting in a 5 on both. The DM rolls a d4 for Wanda's Skilled harm, and a d6 for the mime. This results in success with a complication. Wanda increases her Skilled harm to a d6, and gains an inspiration for taking on harm. In this case the harm represents the anxiety Wanda has about holding up their end of the deal]
Mime: Interesting proposal, so I give you the info now, and you owe me a favor I can call in whenever I want?
Wanda: Uhh... yes I suppose that is what I'm proposing
Ko: Are you sure about this?
Mime: Too late bud, a deal is a deal.
Wanda: Very well
Mime: The lady went that way, and she was in a real hurry. I gotta feeling that she doesn't want to be found.
Wanda: Yes, that does seem to be the case. Thank you very much kind stranger.

Cut to Niera and Clyde fighting mobsters and running through the city

Niera and Clyde make attack rolls against the mobsters. Niera succeeds in blasting one with a spell. Clyde fails with his axe swing, resulting in a miss and a counter attack. 

Niera casts a spell knocking down the attacker. Clyde attacks again, successfully this time.

Niera: How many of these guys are there?
Clyde: Too many, if you ask me.

More mobsters show up and start shooting.

Wanda and Ko find the woman hiding in a warehouse. Wanda embraces the woman, they share a very brief tender moment, which is interrupted by explosions and gunfire outside.

Wanda: Hello, are you here?
Girl: Wanda, is that you?
Wanda: Yes, my dear
Girl: You can't be here. I left to keep you safe
Wanda: I know, but I couldn't live knowing you were alone on the run.

Explosion

Ko: Niera? Clyde? Weren't you supposed to lead the mob away from the girl?
Niera: We didn't exactly know she was going to be in this warehouse.

Mobster: Give us back what's ours, and we'll be happy to leave without a fuss
Girl: It's not yours! You stole it from my family!
Mobster: Alright, have it your way
Mobsters begins shooting

Ko fails a dodge roll, taking Skilled harm

Wanda: You've endangered the one I love, and for that, you will pay
Clyde: Now you've done it
Wanda grows incredibly large, and attacks with Cryptid, Strength, an Asset, and a die from each ally helping out.

A series of attacks ensue. The mobsters run away.

Wanda, to girl: Do you still have it.
Girl, opening mysterious box: Yes, it's safe.
Wanda: Good. We'll help you disappear.
Girl: Will you come with me?
Wanda: I can't, there's still work to do
Girl: ...
Girl: I understand

Ko: At least she's safe
Wanda: Yes, that's all I can really ask for
Ko: You'll see her again you know
Wanda: I know... but you can see your love know, so why are you here with me
Ko: ...
Wanda: You still haven't told him how you feel, have you?
Ko: I'm trying to find the right time
Wanda: How long are you going to do that excuse
Ko: At least one more time
Wanda: Yes, that seems accurate

Later, we see the crew drinking together. Ko has their arm over Wanda. Wanda points out that Ko's love interest is right over there. Niera is in the background, excitedly doing an experiment of some kind.
