# Introduction

Distorted Domains is a Gonzo Science Fantasy Role Playing game for 2 or more players. One of the players takes the role of the Domain Manager, or DM. They are responsible for playing the world and the people in it. The other players take on the role of a Traveler, someone who journeys from domain to domain in search of something, encountering strange new places and helping interesting people with their problems.

Major inspirations include Cortex Prime, GROK?!, TROIKA!, Primal Quest, Doctor Who, Numenara, and the various works of Chuck Tingle.

This game is meant to be weird and silly. The characters are meant to feel powerful, but also goofy. Who you are, what your experiences are, what you're looking for, and why you're looking for it will all play a factor in how characters accomplish their goals. While death is a possibility in Distorted Domains, it will focus more on long term consequences when things get bad. It features an anti-canon setting that allows you to mash up all of your favorite things without worrying what would make sense.
