# Distorted Domains

Distorted Domains takes place in a broken universe that's organized into different Domains. Each Domain will have a theme, and they can vary in size from nearly infinite to a single building. There is no official canon for Distorted Domains, or put another way, all Domains and adventures are officially a part of the infinite number of Domains that make up the universe. 

Travel between domains tends to be rare, and could take many forms. Technologically advanced gates, magical portals, sailing ships going through the void, an interdimensional phone booth, a dangerous trek through the mist, a long walk along a rainbow, mysterious doors leading to an infinite hallway, a rainbow bridge that magically appears where you need it to. Any or all of these could be true. You can also choose not to address it at all and the players can simply show up where they are needed.

## Collaborative Domain Creation

If your group likes, you can build a domain to play in together.

### Step 1 - Size

The first step in domain creation is to determine the size and scope of the domain. Domains can be endless, as small as a single room, or anywhere in between. They roughly break down into the following sizes:
- Seemingly Infinite. With no known ends
- Extremely Large. The size of a planet
- Large. The size of a continent
- Medium. The size of a large city, or distinct geographical region like a forest or mountain range
- Small. A small community with a collection of homes and shops
- Tiny. A single structure, such as a large treehouse, a space ship, or a shopping mall

### Step 2 - Themes

Get a word or phrase from each player at the table, including the GM. This could be anything, like "demons", "gold", "tower", "weird west", "clouds", or "evil". Try arranging the words in different ways until the group comes to a consensus on what their favorite arrangement is. That's the start of your domain. 


D68 | 1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6
:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
1  | Demon	|	Gold	|	Stars	|	Steampunk	|	Aether	|	Revolution
2  | Swords	|	Cloud	|	Mountain	|	Temple	|	Monks	|	River	
3  | Stilts	|	Gears	|	Crystal	|	Giraffe	|	Mechanical	|	Gateway
4  | Automaton	|	Monster	|	Spirit	|	Mushroom	|	Village	|	Boat
5  | Shattered	|	Arcane	|	Island	|	Wolves	|	Swamp	|	Fortress
6  | Ocean	|	Alien	|	High-tech	|	Abandoned	|	Reinforced	|	Walking
7  | Darkness	|	Fire	|	Frozen	|	Spiral	|	Mafia	|	Corporation	
8  | Farm	|	Rotting	|	Tower	|	Quantum	|	Cliff	|	Hut

### Step 3 - Details

Go around the table and have everyone suggest locations, npcs, factions, environment details, and wildlife. Do this until you have a few examples for each category. To flesh out the setting further, connect these details in ways that the group thinks make sense. Putting certain NPCs with specific factions, putting points of interest and specific environment details in specific locations and the like.

### Step 4 - Rumors and Conflicts

Each Player, including the DM, should introduce some sort of mystery, rumor, or conflict within the setting. Maybe two factions are fighting over resources or a location, maybe there's something mysterious going on in a given location, maybe a specific NPC has been acting weird lately, perhaps there are rumours related to unusual wildlife in an area.
