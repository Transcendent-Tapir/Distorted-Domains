# Arko Station

A space station orbiting a black hole beyond its event horizon. The layout feels ever shifting and time can move faster or slower depending on what room you're in. The station is occupied by sentient dinosaurs who have no recollection of who built the station or how they got there. In the center there is a circular room with only one doorway, but you never seem to exit in the same place that you entered.

### The Forgotten Sectors

sometimes sections of the station become lost, losing all connections to the rest of the station. Forgotten sectors can't be found, instead they find you, with unusual doors and pathways that disappear if you look away too long. Such as a spiral staircase coming out of a wall, or a ladder inside a walk in freezer. The only way to escape the a forgotten sector is to hope that you live long enough for the station to release you. Forgotten Sectors often have a higher than normal occurence of spacetime anomalies, radiation, and other unidentified energies. Due to this, they are full of unusual and dangerous lifeforms.
