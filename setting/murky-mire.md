# Murky Mire

Murky Mire is a densely forested swamp, full of dangerous plants and wildlife. The water in the swamp is cloudy, yellow, and viscous. This is because it's full of the digestive enzymes of the trees, which feed on the flesh of any animal unlucky enough to get stuck in the water. There are exploding mushrooms, magpie-squitos, vines that twist and entangle you when you touch them. Even with all of this, there are those that have found their home in the Mire. They learn how to navigate the dark maze of roots and vines, they figure out how to traverse a sea of deadly plants, dangerous animals, and the acidic swamp water.

## Shimmering Fen

A village in an acidic swamp with carnivorous trees. People mostly live in huts raised above the deadly water. The wildlife is large and dangerous. You will see giant insects, amphibians, and reptiles that the denizens have learned to avoid or live along side of.

### The Smoldering Caves

At the edge of the swamp, is the mouth of a cave that goes into the side of an unfathomably high mountain. The side of the mountain is sheer and impossible to climb. The water in the cave is less acidic, and it's home to a number of bioluminescent fungi. Deep in the caves are vents that release a mineral rich smoke, heating the cave and providing nutrients to the life within it, but making it hard to breathe for those that aren't adapted
