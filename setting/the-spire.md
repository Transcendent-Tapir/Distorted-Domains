## The Spire

A glowing crystal tower that rises to the skies from the ocean floor. The water around it turns to vapor. At the bottom is a thriving city full of aquatic mammals run by the orca mafia. Inside lies only mystery.

### Upper Spire

The upper spire sits above the surface of the water. Here there is more light coming in from the windows. The floors at the top are smaller, with tiny rooms and narrow corridoors. This part of the spire is less dangerous than lower floors, and also barren in comparison.

### Lower Spire

### Base city

At the base of the spire is a sprawling city. Built from a combination of natural materials and the scraps of shipwrecks, this place is home to a large number of sea creatures. This bustling metropolis at the bottom of the sea is full of art, beauty, and love as well as corruption, violence, and desperation.
