# The Spire

The Spire is glowing crystal tower that rises to the skies from the ocean floor. The water around it turns to vapor. 
At the bottom is a thriving city known as Spire City full of aquatic animals. Spire City is a diverse metropolis supporting all kinds of sea life where you can find any sort of undersea experience you can think of. Spire City is run by the Orca Mafia, who have their fins in everything. 

Inside the Spire lies untold treasures, danger, and mystery. Some explore the Spire to make great discoveries, others to hide from the Orca mafia, and others still seeking glory from defeating the beasts that lie within.

## Upper Spire

The upper spire sits above the surface of the water. Here there is more light coming in from the windows. The floors at the top are smaller, with tiny rooms and narrow corridoors. This part of the spire is less dangerous than lower floors, and also barren in comparison.

At the base of the spire is a sprawling city. Built from a combination of natural materials and the scraps of shipwrecks, this place is home to a large number of sea creatures.
